# Onboarding
(WIP)

Welcome to BUAlpha, BUFC's quantitative research team.

## Introductions

We will be using this GitHub page (@bualpha) to manage projects, give lectures, and share [resources](https://github.com/bualpha/Resources). You can feel free to check out past archived repositories for project inspirations.

Below are a series of steps and info that will get you acclimated to our workflow.

## For Quantitative Analysts

Here are a series of steps to set up your coding environment for lectures and projects.

1. You need a Code Editor. You may use JupyterLab to run notebooks for lectures, but [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of the most powerful modern code and text editors. If you do not already have a good code editor installed, please download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). \
*Hint:* you may open a file on VSCode from your terminal by running `code <file_name>`.
2. If you do not already know git, check out the [learn-git](https://github.com/bualpha/learn-git) repository for a crash course. You may feel free to use any other resources as well.
3. Lecture materials for **Fall 2023** can be found [here](https://github.com/bualpha/qa-f23).

## For Quantitative Developers

#### Project Templates
Each project repository should include:

* `README.md` showcasing the theory, usage, and any other information
* A clear one or two line describing your work in the `README.md` file and/or in `About` section
* `requirement.txt` or `environment.yaml` file for reproducibility
* `.gitignore` file for organization purposes
* Well organized scripts or notebooks
* `LICENSE` if needed
* `CITATION.cff` if needed (be sure to cite your sources either here or in `README.md`)
* Other `.md` files if needed

Your code should be written so other people on the team can understand. That means salient comments and example codes (if necessary) should be included. A general rule of thumb is that you will not be embarrassed if you were to show your projects to a recruiter. They do not have to be perfect, but a completed and well-organized project will go a long way, demonstrating your competency for real world projects. Sample past projects can be found above in this repository. (Insert submodules)
