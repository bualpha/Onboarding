## For Quantitative Analysts

Here are a series of steps to set up your coding environment for lectures and projects.

1. You need a Code Editor. You may use JupyterLab to run notebooks for lectures, but [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of the most powerful modern code and text editors. If you do not already have a good code editor installed, please download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). \
*Hint:* you may open a file on VSCode from your terminal by running `code <file_name>`.
2. If you do not already know git, check out the [learn-git](https://github.com/bualpha/learn-git) repository for a crash course. You may feel free to use any other resources as well.
3. Lecture materials can be found here.
